# HiHi~ I'm Kuihao
# This is a workflow to help you define actions which you want to deploy 
# the pages on main branch.

# The name of your workflow
name: deploy gh-pages

# To automatically trigger a workflow, 
# use `on` to define which events can cause the workflow to run.
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the main branch
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  #pull_request:
  #  branches: [ main ]
  
  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  #workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially 
# or in parallel. Define a single job below:
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    name: Build and deploy gh-pages
    
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    concurrency:
      group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}

    # Define environment variables
    #env:
    #  MY_SECRET   : ${{secrets.commit_secret}}
    #  USER_NAME   : <Your Name>
    #  USER_EMAIL  : <Your github register email>
    
    # Use `jobs.<job_id>.strategy.matrix`  
    # to define a matrix of different job configurations. 
    # A matrix allows you to create multiple jobs by 
    # performing variable substitution in a single job definition.

    #strategy:
    #  matrix:
    #    node-version: [10.x]
    
    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    # * `Steps` can do three types of behaviors:
    #   * `run` commands (CLI commands in OS)
    #   * `uses` actions (offer by Github workflow or contributors)
    #   * `with` to setting extensive variables (? not very sure...)
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it.
