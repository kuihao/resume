# HiHi I'm Kuihao
# This is a workflow to help you define actions which you want to deploy the pages on main branch
# And the code below is edited from https://reurl.cc/Go9k6x

# The name of your workflow
name: deploy gh-pages

# To automatically trigger a workflow, 
# use `on` to define which events can cause the workflow to run.
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the main branch
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  #pull_request:
  #  branches: [ main ]
  
  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  #workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
# Define a single job below:
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    name: Build and deploy gh-pages
    
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    #runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # ???
    #env:
    #  MY_SECRET   : ${{secrets.commit_secret}}
    #  USER_NAME   : githubaction
    #  USER_EMAIL  : githubaction@fake.com
    #  PUBLISH_DIR : ./dist
    
    # ??? global variables?
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [10.x]
    
    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    # `Steps` can do three types of behaviors:
    # * `run` commands (CLI commands in OS)
    # * `uses` actions (offer by Github workflow or contributors)
    # * `with` to setting extensive variables (? not very sure...)
